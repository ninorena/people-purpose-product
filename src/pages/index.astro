			<h1>Hello, Reader!</h1>
			<p>
			    Welcome to <b>People/Purpose/Product</b>, a blog about building products that actually serve people.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Most products claim to be user-centered, but end up putting users in service to business goals. I'm interested in what it takes to build products that work for people, not against them - especially as AI makes it easier than ever to build the wrong things faster.
			</p>
			<p>
                <b>Here's the opportunity:</b> we're entering a world where anyone can build digital products, not just those steeped in traditional product-led culture. This means that those who want to build products that serve real purposes - whether you're deep in the tech world looking to build differently, or you're just beginning and want to avoid repeating broken patterns - need guidance to avoid repeating the same extractive patterns that plague the industry.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>This blog is a translation layer.</b> I'm here to share what's working and what's not when it comes to building for impact, and to bridge the humanities and technology. If you can imagine a product that genuinely serves people, you're getting closer to being able to build it, and I want that to be a good thing.
			</p>
			<p>
				This blog is for people who sense something's wrong with how we typically build products - whether you're deep in the tech world or just entering it because you believe a digital product can help you do more. If you believe software can create genuine social impact rather than extract value, this space is for you.

				<a href="https://astro.build/integrations">Astro Integrations</a> to add tools like Tailwind,
				React, or Vue to your project.

			<ul>
				<li>Edit this page in <code>src/pages/index.astro</code></li>
				<li>Edit the site header items in <code>src/components/Header.astro</code></li>
				<li>Add your name to the footer in <code>src/components/Footer.astro</code></li>
				<li>Check out the included blog posts in <code>src/content/blog/</code></li>
				<li>Customize the blog post page layout in <code>src/layouts/BlogPost.astro</code></li>
